# CS-355-Project

For this project, we will be using Java. After using socket programming to create a way for two parties to communicate with one another, we implemented the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt and decrypt messages securely. In order for Alice and Bob to securely compare the contents of their files, we allow Alice and Bob to hash the contents of their files locally, then send the hash value to each other with their keys. This way, they can check if the files are identical without sending the contents of their files to each other.
